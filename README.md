### Problem Statement
The <a href='https://www.mygov.in/group-issue/share-your-ideas-pm-narendra-modis-mann-ki-baat-26th-march-2017/'>Mann Ki Baat</a> site has suggestions pouring in every day. These may range from improvement schemes related to Healthcare, Traffic, Taxes or can be simple complaints as well.
But there is no functionality of categorising the messages, hence they form a large chunk of suggesions clustered together. They have to be segregated into distinct categories to increase the ease of access and thereby processing.

Rather than manually classify each suggestion, this project aims at automating this process and categorising the messages into one of the following labels : 
<ol>
  <li>Medical / Safety / Health / Cleanliness</li>
  <li>Education / Achievement</li>
  <li>Agriculture / Farming / Energy</li>
  <li>Transport</li>
  <li>Employment</li>
  <li>Government Initiatives</li>
  <li>Development / Technology</li>
  <li>Law / Bribery / Crime</li>
  <li>Defence / Security</li>
  <li>Finance / Banking</li>
  <li>Others</li>
</ol>

The suggestions are extracted from <a href='https://www.mygov.in/group-issue/share-your-ideas-pm-narendra-modis-mann-ki-baat-26th-march-2017/'>here</a> out of which the top 750 are considered as the training set and the remaining 250 the test set.
